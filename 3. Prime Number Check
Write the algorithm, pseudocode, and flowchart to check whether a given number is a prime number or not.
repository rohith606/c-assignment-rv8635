Algorithm:
Start
 Input: Read the integer value n.
 Check if n is less than or equal to 1:
If n <= 1, print "Not a prime number" and End.
  Loop: Iterate from i = 2 to sqrt(n):
n % i == 0 (i.e., n is divisible by i), then print "Not a prime number" and End.
  If no divisor is found: Print "Prime number".
  End
Pseudocode:
Start
    Input n
    If n <= 1 then
        Output "Not a prime number"
        End
    End If
    
    For i = 2 to sqrt(n) do
        If n % i == 0 then
            Output "Not a prime number"
            End
        End If
    End For
    
    Output "Prime number"
End
