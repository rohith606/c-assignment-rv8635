Algorithm:
•  Start
•  Input: Read the integer value n (size of the array).
•  Input: Read the n elements into an array.
•  Initialize: Set the first element of the array as the initial largest number (i.e., largest = arr[0]).
•  Loop: Iterate through the array from index 1 to n-1:
•	If arr[i] > largest, then set largest = arr[i].
•  Output: Print the largest number.
•  End
Pseudocode:
Start
    Input n
    Declare array arr[n]
    For i = 0 to n-1 do
        Input arr[i]
    End For
    
    largest = arr[0]
    
    For i = 1 to n-1 do
        If arr[i] > largest then
            largest = arr[i]
        End If
    End For
    
    Output largest
End
