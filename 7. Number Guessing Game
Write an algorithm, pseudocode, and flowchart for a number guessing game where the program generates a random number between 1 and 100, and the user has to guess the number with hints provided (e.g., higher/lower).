Algorithm
•  Start
•  Generate a random number between 1 and 100 and store it in randomNumber.
•  Declare a variable guess to store the user's input and attempts to count the number of guesses.
•  Initialize attempts to 0.
•  Repeat the following steps until the user guesses the number:
•	Increment attempts by 1.
•	Ask the user to input a guess and store it in guess.
•	If guess is equal to randomNumber, display "Congratulations!" and stop.
•	If guess is less than randomNumber, display "Higher!".
•	If guess is greater than randomNumber, display "Lower!".
•  Display the total number of attempts.
•  Stop
Pseudocode:
BEGIN
   Import random library
   Generate randomNumber between 1 and 100
   Declare guess, attempts
   attempts ← 0

   REPEAT
      Increment attempts by 1
      Print "Enter your guess:"
      Input guess

      IF guess = randomNumber THEN
         Print "Congratulations! You've guessed the correct number."
         Print "Total attempts: ", attempts
         EXIT
      ELSE IF guess < randomNumber THEN
         Print "Higher!"
      ELSE
         Print "Lower!"
      ENDIF
   UNTIL guess = randomNumber

END
