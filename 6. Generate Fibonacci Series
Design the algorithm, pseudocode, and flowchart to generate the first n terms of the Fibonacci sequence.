Algorithm:
•  Start
•  Declare variables: n (number of terms), a (first term), b (second term), next (next term in the sequence), and i (loop counter).
•  Input the value of n.
•  If n is less than or equal to 0, print an error message and stop.
•  If n is 1, print a and stop.
•  If n is 2, print a and b and stop.
•  Print a and b.
•  Use a loop to calculate the next terms in the Fibonacci sequence:
•	next = a + b
•	Print next
•	Update a = b and b = next
•  Repeat until all n terms are printed.
•  Stop
Pseudocode:
BEGIN
   Declare n, a, b, next, i
   a ← 0
   b ← 1

   Print "Enter the number of terms (n):"
   Input n

   IF n <= 0 THEN
      Print "Invalid input! Enter a positive number."
      STOP
   ENDIF

   IF n == 1 THEN
      Print a
      STOP
   ENDIF

   Print a, b

   FOR i FROM 3 TO n DO
      next ← a + b
      Print next
      a ← b
      b ← next
   END FOR

END
