Algorithm:
•  Start
•  Input two integers a and b.
•  While b is not equal to 0:
•	Compute the remainder of a divided by b (remainder = a % b).
•	Assign the value of b to a.
•	Assign the value of remainder to b.
•  When b becomes 0, the value of a is the GCD.
•  Output the GCD.
•  Stop

Pseudocode:
BEGIN
   Declare a, b, remainder
   Print "Enter two numbers:"
   Input a, b

   WHILE b ≠ 0 DO
      remainder ← a % b
      a ← b
      b ← remainder
   END WHILE

   Print "GCD is:", a
END
